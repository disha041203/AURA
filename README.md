AURA â€” Adaptive, Unified, Responsible Assistant: A safety-first conversational agent that provides evidence-based emotional support using multimodal emotion detection and therapeutic dialogue patterns (CBT-inspired), while prioritizing user safety through explicit risk detection, explainable responses, and human-in-the-loop escalation. The system aims to reduce harm caused by unsupervised AI companionship by implementing verified clinical screening (e.g., C-SSRS), automatic escalation to crisis resources for high-risk users, and transparent logging for auditability.
